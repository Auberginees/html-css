<b> Fairy </b>
<i><big><pre>
  Over hill, over dale,
  Thorough bush, thorough brier,
  Over park, over pale,
  Thorough flood, thorough fire,
  I do wander everywhere,
  Swifter than the moon's sphere;
  And I serve the fairy queen,
  To dew her orbs upon the green.
  The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
  In their gold coats spots you see;
  Those be rubies, fairy favours,
  In those freckles live their savours:
  I must go seek some dewdrops here
  And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
  Farewell, thou lob of spirits;
  I'll be gone:
  Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
</big></i></pre>
<p><b>PUCK</b></p>
<i><big><pre>
  The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
  Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
  For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
  Because that she as her attendant hath
  A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
  She never had so sweet a changeling;
  And jealous Oberon would have the child
  Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
  But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
  Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
  And now they never meet in grove or green,
  By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
  But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
  Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
